    <p class="bio"><em>Fear is Heavy, I've Got Plans ... </em>is the debut recording by Turtle Boat, a free-jazz outfit led by Abhilasha Chebolu (Gault, Princsex, Null Copula, Ryan Jewell Quintet) featuring her compositions with additional contributions from saxophonist Alex Burgoyne (Small Songs, Alex Burgoyne Quartet, Gault, Liver Quiver, Ryan Jewell Quintet). Joined by Dan DiPiero (Small Songs, Alex Burgoyne Quartet, Common Things), the trio first assembled in 2015 after a decade of playing together in various groups and idioms. Though diverse in experience, this band finds common ground through their shared investment in exploring the more introspective side of free playing. In addition to their capacious listening practice (informed by Arvo Pärt, Heavy Vegetable, the Smashing Pumpkins, Thingy, and YMCK as much as Ornette Coleman and Paul Motian), Turtle Boat pursues a generous improvisatory dynamic concerned with playing not what is possible, but what is necessary.</p>
