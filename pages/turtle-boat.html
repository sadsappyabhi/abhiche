<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_ship" target="_blank">Geobukseon</a> was a type of warship used by the navy of the Joseon Dynasty. Turtle Boat takes its name from the ship, and represents a  yearning to be free of externally-imposed isolation, and a wrath towards insincerity and apathy. The group utilizes improvisational vehicles written by Abhilasha (with additional contributions from saxophonist <a href="https://burgoynesax.com/" target="_blank">Alex Burgoyne</a>). Joined by <a href="https://www.dandipiero.com/" target="_blank">Dan DiPiero</a>, the trio first assembled in 2015 after a decade of playing together in various other groups and idioms. Though diverse in experience, this band finds common ground through their shared investment in exploring the more introspective side of free playing. In addition to their capacious listening practice (informed equally by Arvo PÃ¤rt, Kazumoto Endo, Thingy, And YMCK as much as Ornette Coleman and Paul Motian), Turtle Boat pursues a generous improvisatory dynamic concerned with playing not what is possible, but what is necessary.</p>
