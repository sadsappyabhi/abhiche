# This is a test

I am writing some `code` in markdown because supposedly it can be converted into HTML quite easily.

## This is a title for a list
- This is a list item
- This is another list item

### Let's test a block of code as well
```java
public class Testing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Here is another paragraph in markdown. Let's try some ==highlighted== text and maybe some *italics* or **BOLD** and possibly some ~~strikethrough~~.
