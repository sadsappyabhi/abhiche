<h1>Turtle Boat</h1>

<p>Turtle Boat was founded in 2014 and was originally intended to be an open love letter to the music of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unclepaulsjazzcloset/" target="_blank">Paul Motian</a>. Working titles for the group before it became Turtle Boat include <em>"Better Call Paul!"</em> and <em>"The EBBCB"</em>. In Summer of 2015 the group diverged into two quite different ensembles, both retaining the same name. At times, the goal of the trio outfit has been to feature a different drummer for each performance, who is not allowed to be privy to any compositional details of the music until it is being performed. The book is comprised of original compositions by Abhilasha and Alex Burgoyne and seeks to feature the drumset player as much as possible.</p>
