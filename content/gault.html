<h1>Gault</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gaultband/" target="_blank">Gault</a> is a "jazz-adjacent midwestern-eclectic" ensemble out of the mind of <a href="https://www.calebismiller.net/" target="_blank">Caleb Miller</a>. Gault's music features a wide variety of stylistic juxtapositions. In addition to the book of music written by Caleb, the ensemble has also featured compositions by Alex Burgoyne, Seth Dailey, and Abhilasha.</p>
